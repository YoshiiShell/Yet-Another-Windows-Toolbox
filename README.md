# Yet-Another-Windows-Toolbox


A Windows toolbox to help you with performance and getting you started with a Windows install. It uses code from various other scripts combined into one script.

Recommended to run as admin or using NSudo.

Some parts of code (or the ideas) are from Atlas, DuckOS (cannot find link. very sorry), Nyne (Neptune OS), CoutX and (Privacy.Sexy)[https://privacy.sexy/].
